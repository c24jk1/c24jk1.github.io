		<div class="item"> Day One Journal
			<div id="D1"> 2-7-21 So far, we have learned the basics of how to make a website, started to make our own personal websites, and also how to push those websites online to make them accessible to anyone through terminal. For creating our own website, so far we have learned to be able to create "divs", or boxes, to put different things inside them, including changing the color, size, text inside, and putting images in them. I have been able to do all of these things, except I am still working on putting images in by referencing them from my desktop. I have also made some progress on my website, but still need more time to make it fully functioning and finished, such as making it so when you hober over the doors they open. </div>

			<div id="D2">3-7-21 On top of what was written in the first entry, we have continued to practice more coding in html, and have gotten pretty comfortable with that. We also recently started learning how to code in java, which is a little trickier but is starting to make more sense. Specifically we have learned to do smaller things like clicking on a box and making a word appear, but also slightly more difficult codes suh as making a series of images constantly appear, and then also dissapear by clicking on them. Another project we did was making it so whenever you hovered over an area the background color changed, which I turned into a codesketch with a frog. It seems like we're going to continue to learn java which will hopefully become easier with time. </div>

		<div class="item">Day Three Journal
			<div id="D3">3-14-21 Overall, we have learned to code in html and some in java so far. For html, the general structure of it is creating divs or boxes, putting different things in the boxes, and then arranging them. For example, after creating a div you can put other divs in it, change the color, background image, size, the arangement of the divs (for example if they're above or next to each other), change the div if you hover over it, add borders, and much more. However, coding in java can be more complicated. There are three main parts of coding in java we have learned so far. For a variable, it is basically setting two things equivalent to each other, so when one thing is signalled, the other one is brought out. In other words, you are putting certain information inside of something like a word to say what that word does. A function is basically creating something that will complete an action. This basically works by saying that when a certain thing happens like a trigger, another thing follows. Lastly, an event listener is how you make something trigger an action within a function. Basically, as it says in the name, it listens for something to happen, like a click or a key press, and when it hears that action happening it sets off the other part.</div>

		<div class="item">Day Four Journal
			<div id="D4">3-18-21 Since last time I've started to work on a new codesketch with different characters from animated tv shows that I've watched moving on a chess board with different keys. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to make it so when you press an arrow key the move the right amount of space, but I think I just need to look online to figure that out. Anywho, spring break is this weekend so I'll probably try to finish this codesketch for next week, and maybe try to think of a new idea too. <p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p> </div>
