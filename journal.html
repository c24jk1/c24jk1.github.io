		<div class="item"> Day One Journal
			<div id="D1"> 2-7-21 So far, we have learned the basics of how to make a website, started to make our own personal websites, and also how to push those websites online to make them accessible to anyone. For creating our own website, so far we have learned to be able to create "divs" to put different things inside and create different things inside them including changing the color, size, text inside, and putting images in them. I have been able to do all of these things, except I am still working on putting images in by referencing them from my desktop. I have also made some progress on my website, but still need more time to make it fully functioning. </div>

		<div class="item">Day Two Journal
			<div id="D2">3-7-21 On top of what was written in the first entry, we have continued to practice more coding in html, and have gotten pretty comfortable with that. We also recently started learning how to code in java, which is a little trickier but is starting to make more sense. Specifically we have learned to do smaller things like clicking on a box and making a word appear, but also slightly more difficult codes suh as making a series of images constantly appear, and then also dissapear by clicking on them. Another project we did was making it so whenever you hovered over an area the background color changed, which I turned into a codesketch with a frog. It seems like we're going to continue to learn java which will hopefully become easier with time. </div>
