		<div style="color:white;" id="word">It's Sunday Night. You're doing your compsci homework last minute before the Monday morning class where you know no one will say a word. But, you hit a roadblock. You forgot how to make a div and now you can't do the homework. It's too late to make a lab so you decide to go on a walk in the park to think through this problem.</div>
