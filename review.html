		/*array-making it so you create a list of different things and each of those things is assigned a number that you can refer to to get that image

		forloop-something where you say keep creating divs which are each assigned increasing numbers if the number of that div is less than something, so if it was less than 10 you create 10 divs

		set interval-making it do you create a div every x number of miliseconds, so they are continuously created after a certain amount of time

		math.random-making it so each time you click on something, a random number is generated. this is helpful because if you multiply that number by how many different options of things you want to have and round it down, you can randomly select an image out of a group where each image is assigned a number. 
		
		even/odd-making it so each time you click something it counts the number of clicks, and if that number is divided by two and has remander 0, it is even and if it has remander 1, it is odd. This is important because you could set even divs to a certain image and odds to another so if you keep clicking if switches off between two images
